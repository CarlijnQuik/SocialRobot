##Ros workspace for basic control over the MAGABOT robotic platform

This set of programs allows velocity control over the base and inspection of bumpers, battery levels and odometry.

This document assumes familiarity with how ROS (Robotic Operating System) works, specifically:

  - how to create a workspace using catkin
  - how to create a package
  - how to write a simple publisher and subscriber
  - how services work
  - how to compile packages in a workspace
  - how to integrate a third party package in our workspace

Additionally, teleoperation of the base will work as-is, if the user is using a Logitech f710 gamepad in D mode, but movement should be possible using any other Twist publisher.

#First usage

Open a terminal at the root of the workspace (catkin_magabot) and run the following commands:

$catkin_make
$source devel/setup.bash

After these commands, the binaries will be built and running the nodes in this package will be possible.

$roslaunch magabot magabot_joy.launch

Will launch the program that communiates with the arduino, a program which publishes joystick input and a program that converts joystick input to base velocities. Use the left knob to control linear movement and the right to control angular movement.

At this moment, the terminal will accuse any dependencies that are necessary. Install these and repeat.

After the program is launched, the velocities, in the form of ROS Twist messages, may be inspected by running:

$rostopic echo cmd_vel
