    a. If the participant has not picked any trash yet, these sentences are played depending on the position of the participant:
      First time:  "It is really messy around here"                   
      When the robot is next to trash: "Can you pick this up?"
      When the robot is not next to the trash: "Can you pick the trash?"
    b. If the participant has not picked trash after half of the time: 1x "Why aren't you picking the trash?"
      Repeat:
      When the robot is next to trash: "Can you pick this up?"
      When the robot is not next to the trash: "Can you pick the trash?"
    c. Thanking the participant:
      After each thrown away item: "Thank you!"
      After the participant has thrown away a lot of items: "Nice job!"
    d. If the participant has picked up some trash already: 
       "Can you pick up a bit more trash please?"
       "It is still really messy here"
       If the participant has picked less than 5 items: "You can do better"
