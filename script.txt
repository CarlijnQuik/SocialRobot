Playing the game
4. The game starts and goes on for 5-10 minutes.

Experiment 1: Baseline
The robot stays in its place during the entire experiment.

Experiment 2: Movement + sound
The robot moves around and makes sound in the following way:
- We define four spots the robot can move. 
- Every 60 seconds the robot moves to a different spot and speaks one of the sentences specified below. 
- Then it stays in its place for 20 seconds, before replaying this proces.

    a. If the participant has not picked any trash yet, these sentences are played depending on the position of the participant:
      First time: "It is really messy around here"
      When the robot is next to trash: "Can you pick this up?"
      When the robot is not next to the trash: "Can you pick the trash?"
    b. Thanking the participant:
      After each thrown away item: "Thank you!"
      After the participant has thrown away a lot of items: "Nice job!"
    c. If the participant has picked up some trash already: 
       "Can you pick up a bit more trash please?"
       "It is still messy here"
    
Closing
5. The game stops and the participant is requested to fill out a 5-minute survey.
6. The participant fills out the survey.
7. After the participant fills out the survey he/she is thanked, explained that the game could not be won, and receives the option to leave their e-mail address.
